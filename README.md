# Incoming Students vs. Tuition

Given the highly competitive landscape of college recruiting in the State of Florida, a report was generated to determine the total number of incoming students for each academic year in comparison with the price of tuition for each academic year for the last 10 academic years. 
An academic year can be defined as the period of the year during which students attend an educational institution, usually from August to June. This report was generated to aid the University's Board of Trustees at St. Thomas University. 
A board of trustees at universities and colleges are generally made up of 30 to 45 members who operate collectively and through their committees that take on everything from reviewing academic programs to raising funds for the institution and most importantly, protecting the mission of the university.
Simply put, the Board of trustees can be viewed as the governing body of a college or university.

## Running
To run the the code open the .R file ("LinearModelTuitionEnrollment.R") contained in the root directory in RStudio (File -> Open File -> [Directory]/LinearModelTuitionEnrollment.R) , be sure to set your working directory to the directory where you cloned the project.
You can set the working directory by going to the and typing:

`setwd("[directory of cloned project]")`

Once you have set the working directory in RStudio, then, to run a specific block of the code go to that block of code and highlight it by selecting that block of code with your mouse. Once you have selected that code proceed to click on the button with the green arrow pointing to the east that reads "Run"
